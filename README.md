## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast rental bike demand in urban environments. This project explores different machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, to find the most effective approach.

## Data Collection
Data for this project was collected from [source, e.g., publicly available datasets]. The datasets include information on weather conditions, time-based variables (such as hour, day, month), and rental bike usage.

## Data Preprocessing
The data underwent several preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Removing multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was a critical part of this project. Notable steps included:
- **Correlation Analysis:** Using Pearson correlation to assess relationships between variables and with the dependent variable.
- **Multicollinearity Check:** Identifying and removing variables with high VIF values.
- **New Feature Creation:** Addressing high correlation between temperature and dew point temperature by creating a new variable, `temp`, as an average of both.

## Modeling
Multiple machine learning models were developed and compared:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor**

Each model was tuned for optimal performance, with hyperparameters adjusted using cross-validation techniques.

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using various performance metrics, including:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R²)
- Adjusted R-squared

The Gradient Boosting Regressor and Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the top-performing models, offering high accuracy and low error rates.

## Key Findings
- **Temperature and Dew Point Temperature:** These features were highly correlated, leading to the creation of a combined feature `temp`.
- **Feature Importance:** SHAP values were used to assess the impact of each feature on the model’s predictions. Temperature, humidity, and time-based variables were among the most influential factors.
- **Model Performance:** The tuned Gradient Boosting Regressor provided the most accurate predictions, making it the best candidate for real-time deployment.

## Recommendations
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the Gradient Boosting Regressor model for real-time demand prediction to optimize bike distribution.
- **Feature Monitoring:** Continuously monitor key features such as temperature and humidity to refine predictions and improve operational efficiency.

## Conclusion
This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict rental bike demand in urban cities. The findings and recommendations offer practical solutions to optimize bike rental operations, ultimately improving customer experience and reducing costs.
